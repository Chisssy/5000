<h1 id="top">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h1>
<h2 id="The_Woods"> The Woods </h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She lived on the edge of the woods and one beautiful spring morning she decided to take a walk in the woods. She walked and walked and after a long while she came upon a cottage. Although she knew she shouldn't, she wanted to go inside.  First she knocked, but there was no answer.  Then she turned the knob to the front door. It was unlocked!  So she let herself in.  </p>
<h2 id="Living_Room">The Living Room </h2>
<p>There were three chairs in the living room, a great big chair, a medium sized chair and a little chair.  Goldilocks was tired from her long walk and wanted to sit down. She sat in the great big chair, but it was to hard and uncomfortable.  She sat in the medium sized chair, but it was too soft and she sunk into it. She sat in the little chair and it was just right.  She rocked and rocked and rocked until she broke it.  After all that she was hungry. </p>
<h2 id="Kitchen">The Kitchen</h2>
<p>Goldilocks smelled something delicious coming from the kitchen. "I'm so hungry" she said as she walked in the room and saw three bowls of porridge on the table. There was a big bowl, a medium bowl and a little bowl. "I'm so hungry", she said as she sat down at the big bowl, picked up a big spoon and took a big bite.  Goldilocks spit it out.  "Blah! It is too hot!", she said.  She moved over to the medium bowl, picked up the medium sized spoon and took a medium bite.  "Blah!  It is too cold.  I don't like it" She scooted over to the little bowl, picked up the little spoon and took a little bite. "Mmmmm, just right!", Goldilocks ate the whole bowl. Then she became very tired and decide to look for a comfy place to take a nap.
</p>
<h2 id="Bedroom">The Bedroom</h2>
</p>Goldilocks saw three beds, a big bed, a medium bed and a little bed.  She climbed up into the big bed but it was hard as a rock and the blankets were scratchy. "I don't like this", she said. So she climbed into the medium bed but it was too soft. I'm sinking into the mattress. I don't like this either", she said.  Then she climbed into the little bed and pulled up the covers, "Just right." she said. And she fell fast fast asleep.  
</p>
<h2 id="Bears">The Bears</h2>
<p>At short while later the bears came home from picking berries in the forest.  Papa bear walked in the house and announced, "Someone has been sitting in my chair".  Momma bear said,"I think someone has been sitting in my chair too".  And baby bear looked and his chair and began to cry, "Somebody sat in my chair and broke it!".  "Don't worry baby bear,"Momma bear said, " Papa bear will fix it, let's go to the kitchen and get you something to eat."  They all went into the kitchen.  Papa bear said, "Someone took a bite of my porridge." Momma bear said, "Someone took a bite of my porridge!".  Baby bear said, "Someone took a bite of my porridge and ate the whole thing!".  Baby was very upset.  Papa bear said, "That's it!  We are going to find out who did this." And he went to search the house. They all went to the bedroom.  Papa bear said, "Someone has been sleeping in my bed."  Momma bear said, "Someone has been sleeping in my bed".  Baby bear said,"Someone has been sleeping in my bed and she is still there!"  Baby bear roared and woke Goldilocks up.  She was so frighted she screamed and jumped out the window before the bears knew what to do. She ran home to her Mommy. "I'm never going stranger's house again", she said. "Very good", said her Mommy.
