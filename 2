<h1>Golielocks</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl named Goldielocks. On a beautiful spring moring see decided to take a walk in the woods. After a long while she came upon a cottage.  She was a curious little girl.  She tried to open the front door and it was unlocked.  She went inside.  </p>
<h2>The Living Room </h2>
<p>There were three chairs in the living room, a great big chair, a medium sized chair and a little chair.  Goldilocks was tired from her long walk and wanted to sit down. She sat in the huge chair, but it was to hard and uncomfortable.  She sat in the medium sized chair, but it was too soft and she sunk into it. She sat in the little chair and it was just right.  She rocked and rocked and rocked until she broke it.  After all that she was hungry. </p>
<h2>The Kitchen</h2>
<p>Goldilocks smelled something deliscious comeing from the kitchen.  She saw three bowls of porrige on the table, a big bowl, and medium bowl and a little bowl. She was so hungry she sat down at the big bowl, picked of the big spoon and took a big bite.  Goldilock spit it out.  "Blagh! It is too hot!", she said.  She moved over to the medium bowl, picked up the medium sized spoon and took a medium bite.  "Blagh!  It is too cold.  I don't like it" She scooted over to the little bowl, picked up the little spoon and took a little bite. "Mmmmm, just right!", Goldilock ate the whole bowl. After that she was tired and decide to look for a comfy place to take a nap.
</p>
<h2>The Bed Room</h2>
</p>Goldilocks saw three beds, a big bed, a medium bed and a little bed.  She climbed up into the big bed but it was hard as a rock and the blankets were scratchy. "I don't like this", she said. So she climbed into the medium bed but it was too soft. I'm sinking into the matress. I don't like this either", she said.  Then she climbed into the little bed and pulled up the covers, "Just right." she said. And she fell fast fast asleep.  
</p>
<p>At short while later the bears came home from picking berries.  Papa bear walked in the house and instanty announced, "Someone has been sitting in my chair".  Momma bear said,"I think someone has been sitting in my chair too".  And baby bear looked and his chair and begane to cry, "Somebody sat in my chair and broke it!".  "Don't worry baby bear,"Momma bear said, " Papa bear will fix it, let's go to the kitchen and get you something to eat."  They all went into the kitchen.  Papa bear said, "Someone took a bite of my porriage." Momma bear said, "Someone took a bite of my porriage!".  Baby bear said, "Someone took a bite of my porriage and then ate the whole thing!".  Baby was very upset.  Papa bear said, "That's it!  We are going to find out who did this." And he went to seach the house.  The all went to the bedroom.  Papa bear said, "Someone has been sleeping in my bed."  Momma bear said, "Someone has been slpeeing in my bed".  Baby bear said, " Someone has been sleeping in my bed and she is still there!"  Baby bear roared and woke Goldilocks up.  She was so frighted she screamed and jumped out the window before the bears knew what to do.  She ran home to her Mommy.  "I'm never going stranger's house again", she said.  "Very good", said her Mommy.
